# Winter Campaign 2022 Overview

## Summary

The small island of Napf in the south of the Baltic Sea has been an autonomous region of Germany since unification. Formerly a part of East Germany during the Cold War, it became autonomous during the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
A large number of migrants from the Soviet Union and other countries settled in the area, and the issue of the region fully integrating with Germany has been a challenge. 

## Economy

The currency on the island is the Euro.

With a GDP of only â‚¬11,000 per year, the region has significantly lower income compared to mainland Germany. The islands main economy relies on argiculture and tourism, although it's tourism industry is in decline.

## Factions

  - Prime Minister
