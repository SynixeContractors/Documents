# Heavy Anti-Tank

## Role Description

A HAT rifleman is a specialized operator class, and is not considered a standard operator.

The primary role of the HAT rifleman is to eliminate large and heavily armored vehicle threats, such as Main Battle Tanks, and APC's or other heavy vehicles with reactive armor.

### Specialized Equipment

Completing the certification for HAT Rifleman will unlock the ability to operate HAT weapons. The standard HAT weapon is the Titan MPRL Compact.

## Usage

### Titan MPRL Compact

The Titan MRPL Compact (also referred to as just a "Titan") is our solution to reliably countering hostile heavy armor, such as Main Battle Tanks, and other vehicles that have been equipped with reactive armor.

The Titan is equipped with a Infrared sight that is used to lock the rocket onto the target, and once the rocket is fired, the rocket will guide itself utilizing its own infrared seeker. Due to the IR seeker in the rocket, the Titan is a Fire and Forget weapon system, requiring no further input from the operator once the rocket is fired.

The Titan is capable of engaging a target out to a distance of 2000 meters.

#### Firing Modes

The Titan is capable of firing in two separate modes. There is the direct attack mode, which will fire the missile in a relatively linear flight trajectory, and the top down attack, where the missile will climb upwards, and then come down towards the target vehicle from a height of 180 meters. It is the responsibility of the weapon operator to utilize the correct flight mode to ensure a hit on target.

If the target vehicle is heavily armored around the front, back, and sides, a Top Attack should be utilized to ensure destruction of the vehicle. If the target vehicle is under some sort of overhead cover, then consider a direct attack to ensure a hit.

#### Lock-On and Firing Sequence

To begin the lock on process of the Titan, first look through the weapon sight. Depending on conditions, it may be easier to locate the target in either visual or thermal mode.
Once the target has been located, quickly determine whether a Top attack or a Direct attack will be the better choice for eliminating the target. Ensure you are on the correct attack profile (the default key to swap from direct to top attack and vice-versa is "f").
Once the weapon is on the correct attack profile, switch to the thermal sight, and begin the lock-on sequence of the weapon (the default key for this is the "Tab" key). Note that you will have to hold the lock button down until the rocket is fired.
Once the lock-on sequence is completed, and you see a crosshair over the target, and the seek light is illuminated, you may fire the weapon. Ensure your backblast is clear, and you are following proper anti-tank procedures when you fire the rocket.
