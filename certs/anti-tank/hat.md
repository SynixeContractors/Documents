# Heavy Anti-Tank

## Role Description

A HAT rifleman is a specialized operator class, and is not considered a standard operator.

The primary role of the HAT rifleman is to eliminate large and heavily armored vehicle threats, such as Main Battle Tanks, APCs, or other heavy vehicles with reactive armor.

### Specialized Equipment

Completing the certification for HAT Rifleman will unlock the ability to operate HAT weapons. The standard HAT weapon is the Titan MPRL Compact.

## Usage

### Titan MPRL Compact

The Titan MRPL Compact (also referred to as just a "Titan") is our solution to reliably countering hostile heavy armor, such as Main Battle Tanks, and other vehicles that have been equipped with reactive armor.

The Titan is capable of engaging a target out to a distance of 2000 meters.

#### Infrared Guidance

The Titan is equipped with an infrared sight that is used to lock the rocket onto the target, and once the rocket is fired it will guide itself utilizing its own infrared seeker. Because of this, the Titan requires no further input from the operator once the rocket is fired.

There are certain tradeoffs to using an IR seeker. To lock and track the threat, the engine of the threat must be running, and certain types of countermeasures will disrupt the tracking of the target. The two primary countermeasures that a HAT rifleman will have to be mindful of are flares (which burn extremely hot, and may disrupt tracking of the rocket), and smoke (which may block the IR seeker from detecting the target).

#### Firing Modes

The Titan is capable of firing in two separate modes. There is the direct attack mode, which will fire the missile in a relatively linear flight trajectory, and the top down attack, where the missile will climb upwards, and then come down towards the target vehicle from a height of 180 meters. It is the responsibility of the weapon operator to utilize the correct flight mode to ensure a hit on target.

If the target vehicle is heavily armored around the front, back, and sides, a Top Attack should be utilized to ensure destruction of the vehicle. If the target vehicle is under some sort of overhead cover, then consider a direct attack to ensure a hit.

#### Lock-On and Firing Sequence - In Detail

To begin the lock on process of the Titan, first look through the weapon sight and locate the target.
Once the target has been located, quickly determine whether a Top attack or a Direct attack will be the better choice for eliminating the target. Ensure you are on the correct attack profile (the default key to swap from direct to top attack and vice-versa is <kbd>F</kbd>).
Once the weapon is on the correct attack profile, switch to the thermal sight, and begin the lock-on sequence of the weapon (the default key for this is <kbd>Tab</kbd>). You will see a box around the vehicle the Titan is locking appear. Please ensure this is the vehicle you want destroyed. Note that you will have to hold the lock button down until the rocket is fired.
Once the lock-on sequence is completed (you see a crosshair over the target, the seek light is illuminated, and the tone has changed from high beeps to low beeps), fire the weapon when ready.
Once the rocket has been launched, it is strongly encouraged that you and anyone in your vicinity immediately relocate. The threats that require HAT to deal with can quickly locate the source of the rocket, and will likely engage the position with everything they have.

#### Lock-On and Firing Sequence - In Brief

1. Locate the target and quickly assess the best firing mode.
1. Switch to thermals (<kbd>N</kbd>).
1. Hold <kbd>Tab</kbd> to lock the target.
1. Fire once lock-on is complete and you are ready to engage the target.
1. Move. They know where you are now.
