# Medium Anti-Tank

## Role Description

An MAT rifleman is a specialized operator class, and is not considered a standard operator.

The primary role of the MAT rifleman is to eliminate medium and large vehicle threats.

### Specialized Equipment

Completing the certification for MAT Rifleman will unlock the ability to operate MAT weapons. The standard MAT weapons are the PSRL-1, MAAWS Mk4 Mod 1 and Metis-M.

## Usage

### Ranging

All three launchers have the ability to range targets. This is done by pressing the <kbd>T</kbd> while aiming down the sights.

### PSRL-1

#### Rocket Selection

The PSRL-1 also has several rocket variations available for use by MAT operators. Care should be taken while selecting rockets that the correct rocket is being utilized to neutralize the threat. All rockets have a safety fuze of 900m.

Even though the PRSL-1 has several Anti-Tank rocket options, it SHOULD NOT be relied upon to deal with heavily armored threats, instead, heavier HEAT warheads of MAAWS or METIS or a HAT operator should be called in to neutralize the threat, depending on severity and availabilty of operators.

#### PSRL-1 PWS Fire Control Optic

The PSRL-1 PWS is the preferred variant of the PSRL-1 due to the ranging optic on the weapon. The PWS variant optic is equipped with a laser rangefinder integrated into the optic. To utilize the laser rangefinder, place the target under the center mark, and press the "Lase Range" button (default "T"). The range will be displayed to the right of the ranging mark. Once a range is determined, the operator will align the target with the proper ranging hash, and can then begin the firing process.

Alternative to the fire control optic is to use short range sight mounted on the base version of PSRL-1 (like unmaginfied red dot or holographic sight). Such sights are not adjustable for drop and zero and must be practiced and learned by a skilled operator. Such usage while not recommended allows an operator to have better situational awareness.


### MAAWS (Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti-Personnel Weapon System) Mk4 Mod 1

The MAAWS provides a high rate of fire and the ability to fire up to 1,000 meters. It is the primary MAT weapon.

!> The MAAWS has significant backblast. Do not fire the weapon while against a wall or other structure that will redirect the overpressured air back towards you. Exercise caution when firing the weapon.

The MAAWS Mk4 Mod 1 has three different types of projectiles:

**HE 44**: High Explosive 44, use against lightly armored vehicles and bunkers.

**HEAT 55**: High Explosive Anti-Tank 55, use against medium armored vehicles.

**HEAT 75**: High Explosive Anti-Tank 75, use against medium to heavily armored vehicles.

### Metis-M

The Metis-M fires wire-guided missiles capable of hitting targets up to 2,000 meters away. It is the secondary MAT weapon. Being a SACLOS (Semi-automatic Command Line of Sight) weapon, the operator must continually keep the sight on the target until impact.

The Metis-M has two different rocket types:

**9M135 HE**: High Explosive, use against light to medium armored vehicles.

**9M135 HEAT**: High Explosive Anti-Tank, use against medium to heavily armored vehicles.

## Certification

### Theoretical Exam

The trainee should be able to explain the difference between rocket variations (such as HE, AT, HEAT, and Frag), and when to utilize specific rocket types.
