The MAAWS provides a high rate of fire and the ability to fire up to 1,000 meters. It is the primary MAT weapon.

The MAAWS Mk4 Mod 1 has three different types of projectiles:

**HEAT 55**: High Explosive Anti-Tank 55, use against medium armored vehicles.

**HEAT 75**: High Explosive Anti-Tank 75, use against medium to heavily armored vehicles.

### Metis-M

**9M135 HE**: High Explosive, use against light to medium armored vehicles.

**9M135 HEAT**: High Explosive Anti-Tank, use against medium to heavily armored vehicles.
