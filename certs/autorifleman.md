# Autorifleman

## Role Description

An automatic rifleman is a specialized operator class, and is not considered a standard operator.

The primary role of the automatic rifleman is to increase the capability of an element.

### Specialized Equipment

Completing the certification for Automatic Rifleman will unlock the ability to purchase and operate portable machine guns. The standard weapons used by automatic rifleman are the M249E2 and Minimi.

### Usage

#### Suppression

The purpose of suppression is to stop or prevent the enemy from observing, shooting, moving or carrying out other military tasks that interfere (or could interfere) with the activities of friendly forces. An important feature of suppressive fire is that it is only effective while it lasts and has sufficient intensity. Suppressive fire can also be used to cover friendly forces while they advance toward the enemy position.

The primary intended effect of suppressive fire is psychological. Rather than directly trying to kill enemy soldiers, it makes the enemy soldiers feel unable to safely perform any actions other than seeking cover.

When employing suppressive fire to prevent the enemy from moving, use burst fire while rotating through your targets. In cases where a large cluster of targets are moving, longer bursts can be used.

#### Ammo Management

The automatic rifleman should be aware of how much ammunition they have remaining. When a period of long continuos fire is required an assistant autorifleman should be designated to link belts. If an assistant is not available a call should be made over the element radio to notify friendly units that the suppressive fire will soon end, allowing them to take cover if necessary during the downtime.
