# Combat Aid

## Role Description

Combat Aid is taught to all riflemen, as a way to perform basic medical on their buddy and/or nearby teammates.

Combat Aid covers basic medical, such as wound treatment, and stabilizing.

### Specialized Equipment

All rifleman are to carry a set of basic medical equipment, consisting of:

* 5x Bandage (Packing)
    Packing Bandages will repopen, but will take a long time to do so. They are good when a medic is not currently available.
* 5x Bandage (Quik Clot)
    Quick Clot Bandages are great for small wounds. They last a long time before repopping, but are less effective on large wounds.
* 2x Tourniquet
    Tourniquets are used to stop a limb from bleeding, they can be removed after the patient has been stitched by a Medic
* 1x Splint
    Splits are used to fix fractures; a fracture of the legs causes the patient to limp, whereas a fracture of the arm causes the patient to sway heavily while aiming
* 2x Painkillers
    Painkillers are used to manage pain, they cannot be taken within 5 minutes of each other and take 1-2 minutes to take effect

### UI

When treating yourself or another, it is highly reccomended to use the Medical Menu accessible by pressing `H` instead of using the ACE interaction menu.

Colors and icons that appear on the paper doll represent:

* Light yellow to dark red: bleeding wound(s), darker means faster bleed rate
* Light blue: stitched
* Red bone: limb is fractured
* Blue line: limb has a tourniquet applied temporarily stopping bleeding

Within the Medical Menu there are 7 tabs under the `Examine & Treatment` tab. These are as follows:
  * View Triage Card
    * Used to view Triage done to patient
  * View Patient
    * Used to check Pulse, Blood Pressure, Dogtags, Response, depending on what body part is interacted with
  * Bandage / Fractures
    * Used to apply Bandages, Splints, Tourniquets, depending on what body part is being interacted with
  * Medication
    * Used for giving a patient medication such as Painkillers, Morphine, Epinephrine, or Adenosine. Painkillers can only be administerd while the head is selected.
  * Advanced Treatment
    * Used to perform CPR on an unconcious patient
  * Drag / Carry
    * Used to either Drag or Carry the unconcious patient
  * Toggle (Self/Other)
    * Used to toggle Medical Menu between Self and other patient

### Usage

As a rifleman providing aid, once a Medic is on site if you are not instructed to perform an act of medical then it is no longer your responsibility.

#### Wound Treatment

The primary purpose for Combat Aid is to quickly treat each other's wounds during combat, or keeping your buddy alive until the designated Medic(s) can arrive.

  * The primary responsibility during combat is to return fire, unless your teammate is fatally wounded and needs immediate care return fire
  * If immediate fire is not needed you must first assess your teammate within the Medical Menu
  * After assessing your teammate administer treatment in the following order:
    * Tourniquet darker colored limbs without tourniquets
    * Once all dark colored limbs are tourniqueted begin to bandage the torso and head; starting with whichever is colored darker
    * Note: Quick Clots have the lowest chance of the wound reopening, while Elastic Bandages are applied much quicker
    * Afterwards begin bandaging remaining limbs, the section will turn white once no more bandaging is needed
    * Splits may be applied at this time if teammate is conscious
    * Lastly call for a Medic to complete medical treatment

#### MIST Report

A MIST report is used to quickly convey the status of a downed teammate to the medic on site.

* **Mechanism**: What was the cause of injury; Speed, Mass, Height, Restraints, Number/Type of collisions, Weapon Type
* **Injuries**: What injuries have been caused; Backblast, Grenade, Bullet Wounds, etc.
* **Symptoms and Vitals**: Current status of the patient; Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Injuries, etc.
* **Treatments**: What aid has been applied; Bandages, Tourniquet, Splints, etc.
