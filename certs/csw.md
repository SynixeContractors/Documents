# Crew Service Weapon

## Role Description

A crew-served weapon is any weapon system that is issued to a crew of two or more individuals performing the same or separate tasks to run at maximum operational efficiency, as opposed to an individual-service weapon, which only requires one person to run at maximum operational efficiency.

### Specialized Equipment

Completing the CSW certification will allow the contractor to utilize CSW on future contracts including the M2 Static .50 and the static Mini-Spike Static AA. Both utilize the M3 Deployable Tripod.

## Usage

- Static M2
  - Also known as a “Static .50”
  - The M2 should be used when we are either in a fortified location as a defense asset or if we are posed against a bigger threat and we are in need of more firepower
  - Your ordinary static machine gun. It's even used on technicals!

### Assembly

When assembling the CSWs, it is pretty straightforward.

1. Tripod is placed
2. Gun is attached
3. Ammo is loaded, and gunner hops on
