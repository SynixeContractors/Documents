# Engineering - Explosives Ordnance Disposal

## Equipment

**VMH3**: A handheld metal detector used for mine detection.

**Defusal Kit**: A kit used to defuse mines.

**Marker Flags**: A set of flags used to mark mines.

**Spray Paint**: A can of spray paint used to mark mines.

## Mine Detection

EOD specialists can use various methods to detect mines.

### Visual Detection

Mines can be visually detected by looking for the following:

- Minefield signs
- Piles of debris
- Protusions from the ground
- Wires

### Metal Detection

Mines can be detected by using a handheld metal detector.

1. Equip the VMH3 by pressing <kbd>2</kbd>.
2. Activate the VMH3 via ACE `Self Actions > Equipment > Metal Detector > Active`.
3. Move the VMH3 over the ground to detect mines.

The device will deactivate every time it is unequipped and will need to be reactivated.

By default the mine detector will beep aloud when a mine is detected. The operator can put on headphones so that the beeping is not heard by others.

#### Sweeping

Sweeping is a technique used to detect mines by moving the metal detector over the ground in a sweeping pattern. This is done to ensure that the entire area is covered. The operator should always move forward in the direction of their metal detector, never backwards or sideways. It is reccomended to be crouched and moving slowly (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) whenever possible.

Doorways and other narrow areas should be swept by moving the metal detector in a zig-zag pattern. They are more likely targets for mines and should be checked more thoroughly.

#### Building Clearing

Clearing buildings with a possible EOD threat is an extremely dangerous task. A two person team should be used to clear a building. An EOD specialist should be paired with a rifleman for security. The EOD specialist should be in front and crouched, while the rifleman should be behind and standing. The rifleman should be ready to engage any threats that may be encountered. Regardless of the threat, the rifleman should never pass the EOD specialist, they may be falling into a trap. In the tight quarters of a building, the effect of a mine is amplified and can easily kill both the EOD specialist and the rifleman. Extreme caution must be taken.

### Mine Marking

Mines can be marked with flags or spray paint. This is done to minimize the risk of accidentally triggering a mine.

- All mines should be marked with spray paint, and a flag whenever the ground surface permits it.
- If the operator is unsure if a mine is present, it should be marked.
- If the oeprator is unable to reach a mine, an arrow should be sprayed on the ground to indicate the direction of the mine.
- If the mine is near a wall, the wall should also be marked.

**Red**: A mine is present

**Orange**: A mine is present further down a corridor, hallway, or other narrow area

**Green**: A mine is not present, or has been cleared 

## Mine Disposal

Mines can be disposed of in a variety of ways.

**Explosive**: Mines can be destroyed by using controlled explosives. This is the preferred method whenever possible as it has the least risk of injury to the operator.

**Bullet**: Many mines can be destroyed by shooting them with a bullet from a safe distance.

**Defusal**: Mines can be defused by using a defusal kit. This is the least preferred method as it has the highest risk of injury to the operator.

Some mines cannot be activated by a person, and must be activated by a vehicle. These mines are called vehicle activated mines (VAMs). VAMs can be safely defused by using a defusal kit.

### Explosive Charge

Explosive disposal is the preferred method of mine disposal. It is the safest method for the operator and has the least risk of injury. The operator should use the least amount of explosive to destroy the mine. The charges can be placed a few meters away while still being effective in most cases. If multiple mines are present, they should be destroyed in a single charge whenever possible.

Follow the steps in [Explosives Handling](specialists/engineer/explosives.md) for the proper use of explosives.

After the explosive has been detonated, the operator should recheck the area under the presumption that the mine was not destroyed.

### Bullets

Mines can be destroyed by shooting them with a bullet from a safe distance. This is the second preferred method of mine disposal. It is safer than defusal, but still has a risk of injury to the operator. The operator needs to ensure the mine is safe to engage and has the final say on whether or not to engage the mine with bullets. Another member of the team is allowed to be the one taking the shot, this should be designated as a single individual and not multiple people. The operator must still give the final approval and be on radio with the shooter during the process. Both the operator and the shooter need to be aware of the risk of injury from the explosion and any possible ricochet.

### Defusal

Vehicle activated mines (VAMs) can be safely defused using a defusal kit. The following section does not apply to VAMs. Typical precautions should be taken while defusing VAMs. The operator should be aware of the risk of injury from an explosion in the event one does occur.

Defusal is the least preferred method of mine disposal. It is the most dangerous method for the operator and has the highest risk of injury. The operator should only use a defusal kit if the mine is safe to defuse and there is no other option. Only attempt to defuse a mine when the operator is confident in their ability to do so safely, and all other options have been exhausted.

Conditions for defusal:

- Area is free of other mines that can be defused by other means
- Area is free of all other persons, friendly, enemy, or civilian
- The operator is confident in their ability to defuse the mine safely
- The operator has the proper equipment
- The operator has had proper training with the mine type
- The operator is wearing all required PPE:
    - Helmet
    - Body Armor
    - Hearing Protection
    - Explosive Resistant Uniform

The operator should be crouched and moving slowly (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) whenever possible. 

Approach the mine from a direction that has already been swept. If the mine is directional, always approach from the mine's rear side. If the mine is not directional, approach from the side that has the least amount of debris or restrictions. Make sure your team is aware of your location, the mine's location, the direction you are approaching from, and the direction they should approach from in the event you are incapacitated.

The operator should be crouched and moving slowly (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) whenever possible. Making sure to be very aware of their surroundings and any possible threats.

Hold <kbd>Windows</kbd> until the option to defuse the mine is within reach. Release the <kbd>Windows</kbd> key to begin defusing the mine. The mine will be defused after a few seconds.

The mine should be recovered and stored safely until it can be returned to base or destroyed. Be aware that mines stored in a vehicle may be detonated by a vehicle fire or violent impact.
