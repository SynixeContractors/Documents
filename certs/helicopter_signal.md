# Helicopter Signalling

## Role Description

Helicopter Signalling is a non-specialized certification. It is required by all leadership and recon roles.

A person with helicopter signalling will be able to locate and mark an LZ for a helicopter.

### Equipment

Smoke grenades are used to mark an LZ during the day.
For each LZ:

- 1x colored smoke grenade

Signal flares are used to mark an LZ at night.
For each LZ:

- 1x Red Signal
- 1x Green Signal
- 2x Yellow Signal

## Usage

Finding a suitable LZ is done by:

- Locating an open, flat area that is at minimum 1.75 times the diameter of the helicopter rotor.
- Clear of any obstructions.
- Has a clear approach path that is free of high obstacles such as trees or power lines.

During the day the LZ is marked by a colored smoke grenade. The color **must not** be broadcast over the radio.
The color must either be predetermined before the mission or called out by the helicopter pilot and confirmed on the ground.

During the night the LZ is marked by hand signals or high brightness chemlights using the patterns marked below. The helicopter will approach the LZ from the side of the yellow marks, landing between the furthest yellow mark and the red and green.

!> Signal flares only last for 60 seconds. The signaller must wait for the helicopter to request the flares. The LZ must be marked again if the helicopter is unable to land within that time.
