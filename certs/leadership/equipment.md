## Tools

### Command Radio

Leadership is expected to carry a command radio, and be able to communicate with other teams.

This will usually be the AN/PRC-152.

Using the ACE Self Interact Menu <kbd>Ctrl + ⊞ Win</kbd> you can change the ear the radio is on, and which is your primary radio (PTT1), used with <kbd>⇪ Caps Lock</kbd>, and which is the secondary radio (PTT2), used with <kbd>Ctrl + ⇪ Caps Lock</kbd>.

In some situations, you may need to use a vehicle rack, or an AN/PRC-117F. The AN/PRC-117F is a larger radio, and will require significant space in your backpack. Vehicle racks are accessed by using the ACE Self Interact Menu <kbd>Ctrl + ⊞ Win</kbd> while in a crew position in a vehicle.

Rather than carrying a larger 117F, you can also carry a ground spike antenna (GSA), which can be placed and used to extend the range of your 152. It increases the height of your transmission, and the transmission power, which can be the difference between being able to communicate with a team, and not.

### Map Tools
