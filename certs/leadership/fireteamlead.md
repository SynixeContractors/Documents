# Leadership - Fire Team Leader

A fire team leader (FTL) is the lowest level of leadership in Synixe. They are usually responsible for a team of 4 members, and are expected to be able to lead them effectively in combat. Their goal can range from "Move to that wall" to "Secure that town". They need to be ready to make decisions and operate as part of a large element, or independently.

## Gear Checks & Team Management

The FTL's role starts before the mission, by ensuring their team is prepared for the mission, and is ready to go.
They need to make sure their team:

- Is kit'd up appropriately for the mission at hand
- Knows the greater plan, and their team's role in it
- Is aware of the rules of engagement (ROE)
- Is on the correct radio channels
- Knows who their buddy is

During gear checks, everyone in the team should go over:

- Their role (Rifleman, Marksman, Autorifleman, Medic, etc)
- That they have all of the required gear for a contractor
- That they have all speciailized gear
- They have enough ammunition, a bodybag, and a map, gps, and compass
- They are on the correct radio channels, and appear on the map with radio GPS
- Any tools they have (LAT, Entrenching Tool, Grenadier, etc)

As the FTL, you should ensure you learn from the gear check:

- Who is in your team
- Who is a specialist
- Who has tools

## Leading Your Team

### Movement

FTLS should set the order, speed, and direction of any movements their element needs to make. The order should be clear to everyone in the element, and use the buddy system. The EL can anywhere in the order, but being at the front provides the most effective leading however with extra risk.

There are 6 different speeds of movement with weapons in Arma.

#### Weapon Raised

- **Combat Walk** <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>
- **Combat Jog** <kbd>C</kbd>

#### Weapon Lowered

- **Walk** <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>
- **Slow Jog** <kbd>CC</kbd>
- **Jog**
- **Sprint** <kbd>â‡§ Shift</kbd>

Walking while crouched uses significantly more stamina than being upright. Use lightly.

Handrails are useful terrain features that can aid with keeping on tracking during large movements. Handrails can be rivers, streets, cliffs, etc. Make mental notes to travel on the left or right, and usually at least 200m away. You can also pick out a mountain, tall building, etc. as a target to walk towards.

Avoid travelling through open areas, or utilize bounding when there is not an alternative. Use valleys, bushes, trees, or any other terrain features that give your element cover, concealment, and an advantageous position over your adversary.
