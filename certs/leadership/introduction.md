# Leadership - Introduction

## Role Description

Leadership positions at any level, from fire team leader (FTL) to operation lead (OL) are positions of responsibility to their team and the operation.

The primary role of a leader is to provide direction and guidance to their team. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Providing clear and concise orders
- Ensuring the safety and well-being of their team
- Ensuring the success of the operation

## Responsibilities

Regardless of the level of leadership, the core responsibilities of a leader are the same.

A good leader:

- Is approachable and friendly
- Is confident and assertive in their decisions
- Knowledgable of the operation and the teams
- Dependable and reliable to their superiors and subordinates
- Able to work independently and as part of a greater team
- Puts the safety, success, and enjoyment of their team above their own

## Expectations

A person that takes on leadership positions takes on a high role within the community. They set the standard for the rest of the community, and are expected to know and act within the rules and guidelines of the community at all times.

Keeping your team positive, motivated, and focused is a key part of being a leader, during high stress situations, and during the downtime.

## Authority

In our semi-milsim environment, the leadership is responsible for the safety and success of their team, and need to be ready to use their authority to ensure this.

People in leadership positions need to be friendly and approachable, but also firm and assertive when necessary. They need to be able to make decisions and stick to them. We want our leadership to be confident and assertive to their teams, but not lose sight of the fact that they are also a part of the team and here to have fun.

## Continuous Skills Improvement

Leadership is a skill that is developed over time, it takes practice and determination. Mistakes will happen alongside triumphs, the only way to fail as a leader is to fail to learn and improve. No one here will expect you to make the perfect decisions.

Working effectively with teams above and below you, communicating effectively and clearly, making decisions under pressure, adapting to changing situations, and owning and learning from mistakes are all skills that extend beyond Arma and into the real world.
