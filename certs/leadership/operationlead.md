An operation leader (OL) is the highest acting leadership in Synixe during an operation. They are responsible for all teams, their assets and mission success. OL's are combat leaders, but their focus on mission execution is paramount. To achieve their goals, OL's must weigh multiple variables, including their teams ability to fight; the enemies ability to respond; terrain and time constraints. 
- King, as part of the bigger picture, is also the positioning of teams (BOF, Manuevre elements etc...), 
- Best, combat leader, is it not mission leader?
- Austin, OL fulfills a strategic role, not a tactical role. Giving tactical orders becomes micromanaging.

- Direct tactical commands, if necessary, to the FTL - not to the team itself.

## Team Management

The OL's role starts before the mission, by ensuring team rosters are made, making sure a general plan has been prepared and the teams have been briefed.
They need to make sure their teams:

- Have the appropriate roles and tools for their tasking
- Are aware of the missions objective(s)
- Knows the greater plan, and their team's role in it
- Are aware of the rules of engagement (ROE)
- Are on the correct radio channels
- Appropriate vehicles are prepared

- Setting up team rosters, effective teams
- having roster done on time, as early as possible and YRGB
- Weapons teams, how to do it?

- In the absence of a weapons team, put force multipliers, support roles on yellow

Good leaders are aware of the assets and roles available to them and understand their strengths and weaknesses so that they can be utilised effectively. Plan your teams accordingly:

### Squad Leader (SL)

The SL

### Fireteam Leader (FTL)
 [Fireteamlead](certs/leadership/fireteamlead.md)

 The FTL is responsible for the safety and combat readiness of their team. They feed the OL with accurate and live information from the ground; whilst leading their teams in combat situations. Each FTL has their personal strengths and weaknesses; an OL can consider those when tasking the FTL and their team. It is important for the OL to listen to their FTL's and trust their judgement. FTL's can be expected to:
 - Provide accurate information from the ground;
 - Povide no-BS assesments on combat readiness and effectiveness;
 - 

### UAV Operator
 
 [UAV](certs/uav.md)

 UAV's are vital for providing live information from the sky, to the OL and their respective SL and FTL's. UAV's can be used to:
 - Locate targets;
 - Identify hostile forces;
 - Identify potential hazards and dangers;
 - Discover routes of safe passage;
 - Laze targets for indirect fire and/or precision munitions.

 However, it is important to consider their limitations:

 - Altitude & terrain impacts the signal range and video feed quality;
 - The operator has to be stationary to operate the UAV;
 - The AR-2 Darter is very heavy and can impact the operators mobility;
 - Deploying Drone 40's is loud;
 - UAV's are battery powered, said batteries need to be changed every so often and may result in downtime.

### Medic's
 [Medic](certs/medical/medic.md)
 Medics are lifesavers, it is important to have enough medics for the amount of contractors

### Automatic Riflemen (AR)

### Light Anti-Tank (LAT)

### Medium Anti-Tank (MAT)

### Heavy Anti-Tank (HAT)

### Crew Served Weapon (CSW)

### Engineers and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)

## Mission Planning

### METT-TC
#### Mission
Objectives, Intent and ROE
#### Enemy
#### Terrain and Weather
#### Troops and Support Available
#### Civil Considerations

- Austin: ROE, convoy style, response to contact maybe in SOP

### Concept of Operations
#### Command and Control / Chain of Command
2IC, 3IC, 4IC and Seniority.
#### Scheme of Maneuver
How forces will move and fight.

- King: Response to contact

#### Timelines and Control Measures
Mission timeline, sequence of events, checkpoints, boundaries, phase lines and rally points.
#### Insertion
#### Action
- Team placement, fire without movement is a waste of ammunition, movement without fire is a waste of lives.
#### Consolidation
#### Extraction
#### Contingencies (PACE)
Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency.
- King: Response to contact

### Theoretical Exam

Some of these questions are covered in the above text, some are not. If there is a question you do not know the answer to, we encourage you to give it a Google or ask someone in the community. Some of the answers are subjective, and we encourage you to think about the question and answer it as best as you can.
