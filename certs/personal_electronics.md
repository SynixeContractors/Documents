        4.1 Press and hold both R and Tab ↹ until the red pointing circle appears.
        4.2 Sight the circle on the object and release both keys.
    5. The data on the main menu now has changed, you can now see the azimuth the range and the elevation of the point you sighted.
    6. Note that the compass menu also changed and now features the azimuth, compass bearing, distance and grid position of the point you sighted.

    Note that the results of the measure you took won’t change until you do an other measure.

## Vector 21 rangefinder

The Vector 21 is a rangefinder with a larger set of capabilities than other choices that are more readily available. It comes in two versions the Vector 21 being the regular version and the Vector 21 Nite which enables the person carrying it to make use of night vision capabilities.

The capabilities of the Vector 21 are:

- Distance to a target
- Azimuth to a target
- Horizontal and vertical distance to a target
- Distance between 2 targets
- Angle between 2 targets
- Switching the distance measurment unit between feet and meters
- Switching azimuth measurement unit between degrees and mils
