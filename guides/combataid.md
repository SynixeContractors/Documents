# Combat Aid Guide

## Role Description

Combat Aid is taught to all riflemen, as a way to perform basic medical on their buddy and/or nearby teammates.

Combat Aid covers basic medical, such as wound treatment, and stabilizing; as well as airway management.

## Specialized Equipment

All rifleman are to carry a set of basic medical equipment, consisting of:
* 10x Bandage (Elastic)
    Elastic Bandages are the fastest bandages to apply but have a high chance of the wound reopening
*  5x Bandage (Quik Clot)
    Quick Clot Bandages have the lowest chance of the wound reopening but take longer to apply than Elastic Bandages
*  4x Tourniquet
    Tourniquets are used to stop a limb from bleeding, they can be removed after the patient has been stitched by a Medic
*  2x Splint
    Splits are used to fix fractures; a fracture of the legs causes the patient to limp, whereas a fracture of the arm causes the patient to sway heavily while aiming
*  2x Guedel tube
    Guedel tubes are used to manage airways and allow the patient to breathe
*  2x Painkillers
    Painkillers are used to manage pain, they cannot be taken within 5 minutes of each other and take 1-2 minutes to take effect

## Usage

### Airway Management

Managing airways is crucial to keeping your partner alive until the dedicated Medic(s) can arrive. Managing airways consists of:
  * Checking the patients airways (using Check airways)
    * The airway can be in one of three states:
      * No obstruction, No occlusion
      * Obstructed, no occlusion
      * Obstructed, occluded
    * If airway management is needed/occluded a guedel tube must be inserted
    * A guedel tube cannot be inserted if the airways are obstructed, turn the head (Head turning) until the obstruction is removed

  The airways of a patient must be checked often, if an occlusion appears at any point you must repeatedly turn the head (Head turning) to clear the obstruction


### Wound Treatment

The primary purpose for Combat Aid is to quickly treat each other's wounds during combat, or keeping your buddy alive until the designated Medic(s) can arrive.

  * The primary responsibility during combat is to return fire, unless your teammate is fatally wounded and needs immediate care return fire
  * If immediate fire is not needed you must first assess your teammate
    * Colors and icons that appear on the paper doll represent:
      * Light yellow to dark red: bleeding wound(s), darker means faster bleed rate
      * Light blue: stitched
      * Red bone: limb is fractured
      * Blue line: limb has a tourniquet applied temporarily stopping bleeding
  * After assessing your teammate administer treatment in the following order:
    * Tourniquet darker colored limbs without tourniquets
    * Once all dark colored limbs are tourniqueted begin to bandage the torso and head; starting with whichever is colored darker
    * Note: Quick Clots have the lowest chance of the wound reopening, while Elastic Bandages are applied much quicker
    * Afterwards begin bandaging remaining limbs, the section will turn white once no more bandaging is needed
    * Splits may be applied at this time if teammate is conscious
    * Lastly call for a Medic to complete medical treatment
