# Crew Service Weapon Guide

## Role Description

A crew-served weapon is any weapon system that is issued to a crew of two or more individuals performing the same or separate tasks to run at maximum operational efficiency, as opposed to an individual-service weapon, which only requires one person to run at maximum operational efficiency.

## Specialized Equipment

Completing the CSW certification will allow the contractor to utilize CSW on future contracts including the M2 Static .50 and the static Mini-Spike Static AA. Both utilize the M3 Deployable Tripod.

## Usage

### CSW Types
- Static Mini-Spike
  - Often referred to as “Static AA”
  - The Mini-Spike should be used when the airspace is occupied with enemies
  - Lock on targeting system used against air assets
- Static M2
  - Also known as a “Static .50”
  - The M2 should be used when we are either in a fortified location as a defense asset or if we are posed against a bigger threat and we are in need of more firepower
  - Your ordinary static machine gun. It's even used on technicals!


### Assembly

When assembling the CSWs, it is pretty straightforward.

1. Tripod is placed
2. Gun or Missile is attached
3. Ammo is loaded, and gunner hops on
4. Ready to fire

Disassembly is just as easy, just assembly, but backwards.

1. Unload ammo
2. Detach Gun or Missile
3. Pickup tripod
