# Standard Operating Procedures

## Mindset

No one expects every operator to know every part of the SOP and every part of certifications. What we do expect is that everyone does the best of their ability and works to improve their skills. Willingness to work as a part of a team and interest in improving are required to be a member of this community, not individual skill level. You do not need to learn this entire document at once, instead use it as a reference to improve over time.

Teamwork is everything. Working problems as a team is what leads to successful operations and good memories of our time together playing Arma 3.

## Standard Kit

- 2+ Secondary Magazines
- 10 Bandages
- 2 Painkillers
- 2 Splints
- 2 Tourniquets
- 1 Bodybag
- Compass
- Watch

### Weight

Weight is an important factor to consider, do not bring unnecessary equipment that will slow you down, this puts your element at risk by reducing the ability to react and adapt to the changing battlefield.

## Operation Stages

### Intel Briefing

The mission maker or OL will go over the provided intel, ROE, and completion requirements.

### Planning

The OL will draw up plans for the operation, covering vehicle convoys, waypoints, rallypoints, points of interest, etc. The OL is responsible for the delegation of duties to the ELs.

### Element Briefing

The OL and ELs will brief everyone, covering intel, ROE, completion requirements, responsibilities of each element, and any planned movements.

### Spot Check

ELs will check every member of their element for radios, ammo, medical equipment, special equipment, and any mission specific requirements. Before completing the spot check, every operator should know their buddy and color, the responsibilities of their element in addition to the overall plan.

### Operation

During the operation follow the direction of your leaders, and utilize the certifications, training, and SOP to the best of your ability. The operation phase does not end until all members are safely at an FOB.

### After Action Report

Every EL will go through their element's timeline of events, goals, and outcomes. This section of the mission **is not a debate**, it is instead a recap of the events. All comments should be held until the open debate unless prompted.

Each leader should cover:

1. What happened
2. What was done well
3. What could be improved
4. Were any lessons learned for the future

### Open Discussion

The mission is officially over at this point, and the conversation is open for anyone to expand on the points made during the AAR. Hostile debates will not be permitted, and this time is instead used to share moments from the mission, and discuss the events in more details.

## Composition

Each mission must have an Operation Lead (OL).

The OL is responsible for dividing up members into elements.

### Squad Composition

For the overwhelming number of contracts all contractors will be in one squad. A squad is broken into multiple elements.

#### Roles

**Operation Lead (OL)**  
Responsible for setting the objectives for the squad. Responsible for keeping track of each element's progress and coordinating multi-element maneuvers.

**Element Leader (EL)**  
Responsible for planning and executing their elements movements as part of the OL's set objectives.

**Primary**  
Responsible for responding for a team on the element radio.

#### Example Structures

![](img/squad_c.png ':size=150x150') 
![](img/squad_d.png ':size=150x150') 

### Element Composition

The maximum element size is 8, and should be no smaller than 4. Each element is made up of 2 man teams.

- <span style="color:#999900">Lead</span>
- <span style="color:green">Fireteam</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Fireteam</span>
- <span style="color:red">Medic</span>

Each team should have a "primary", the person responsible for responding for that team on the radio.

#### Specialized Units

Elements should try to spread out specialized units when possible. Having too many specialized units in a squad reduces the ability to adapt to a wide range of combat scenarios. Specialized operators should be paired with non-specialized operators. Ultimately the organization of the teams is up to the mission requirements determined by the OL. Each squad should try to follow the specified limits unless dictated otherwise by the mission.

- 1 Medic
- 1 EOD / Engineer / UAV Operator
- 2 Autorifleman / Marksman

A medic is recommended in elements of 6, and required in elements of 8.

At least 40% of a element must be non-specialized operators. Elements should aim for 50% non-specialized. Marksman using 5.56mm with a scope that can be used in short ranges can be considered Operators if determined appropriate for the mission by the EL.

#### Example Elements

| Primary      |              || Primary      |              || Primary      |              |
|--------------|--------------||--------------|--------------||--------------|--------------|
| EL           | Operator     || EL           | Operator     || EL           | Operator     |
| Operator     | Autorifleman || Operator     | Autorifleman || Operator     | EOD          |
| Operator     | Marksman     || Operator     | Medic        || Operator     | Operator     |
| Operator     | Medic        ||              |              || Operator     | Medic        |

| Primary      |              || Primary      |              || Primary      |              |
|--------------|--------------||--------------|--------------||--------------|--------------|
| EL           | Engineer     || EL           | Autorifleman || EL           | UAV Operator |
| Operator     | Autorifleman || Operator     | Marksman     || Operator     | Marksman     |
| Operator     | Medic        || Operator     | Marksman     ||

### Radio Usage

The standard radio is the AN/PRC-148.

Every element is on it's own channel. Teams may optionally carry an AN/PRC-343, but it is not required and should be avoided in most cases. Proximity voice is the preferred communication method for teams, as they should never be outside of vocal range.

When multiple elements are present, ELs may carry either an AN/PRC-148 or an AN/PRC-117F if required by the mission.

## Base Procedures

When at base all operators should have weapons either unloaded or on their back. Having your gun on safety is not acceptable on its own.
