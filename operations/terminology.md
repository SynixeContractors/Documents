## Tactics

### Contact

1. A potentially hostile enemy.
    - Used to note a potential hostile in a particular bearing/range from the unit. This could be used for unknowns as well. 

### Threat/Tango

1. An enemy unit which is engaging friendlies.
    - Threat/tango is the natural progression of a contact who has become aware of friendlies and engagement.

### A.D.D.

1. Alert, Direction, Distance
    - A quick verbal warning given to all members indicating a hostile contact spotted.
    - Examples:
        - "4 man patrol, 1-6-5, 100 meters moving toward us!"
        - "2 technicals, 2-8-3, 500 meters and closing!"
        - "Contact! Squad, East, distance close!"
    - Key points:
        - Don't use "to my right" or "behind me". These terms are confusing to a group. Use cardinal directions, or bearings. Whichever is more appropriate.
        - Convey via appropriate medium. If you are near everyone who would be able to engage, talk locally. If your entire squad is spread out, use radio.
        - In the event contact is called out, everyone should relay that callout in local chat to everyone near them.

### 360 Degree Security

1. A concept in which everyone in the unit covers a direction around the units space.
    - This ensures no unseen hostiles can sneak up and compromise the unit's security.

### Rules of Engagement

1. Rules defining the who/what/when/where/why of how combat will be conducted by BLUFOR.
    - Without specific briefs, ROE should be that targets should meet the threat triangle before engagement.

### Threat Triangle

1. A set of three rules denoting if a unit can be engaged.
    - A target must have capability (They possess a weapon).
    - A target must have the ability (Their weapon can cause harm to you at their engagement range).
    - A target must have intent (They must show their intent by actively attempting to point/raise the weapon at you or friendlies).

## Navigation

### Waypoint

1. A specific location in the Area of Operations which the unit is supposed to travel through.
    - Set generally at mission start and dynamically as needed.

### Rallypoint

1. A specific location understood by all team members as being the fallback point should everything go wrong.
    - Set generally at mission start and dynamically as needed.

### Vehicle Rallypoint

1. A location where a convoy pre-determines to disembark from vehicles to continue a patrol on foot.
    - Typically out of audio range of targets and in a concealed location.

## Communications

    - Used to call over the radio to request silence on the line. This is used ONLY when urgent messages are coming through.
2. "Break"
    - Used in between long messages to open the air for any other potential messages.
    - For messages longer 5 seconds, it is normal to break about every 5 seconds.
3. "Say Again"

4. "Out"
    - Used by the calling party in a radio conversation to be the end of traffic from the caller.
5. "Over"
    - Used by either party in a radio conversation to identify the end of the transmitted message, but not the conversation.
6. "Repeat"
    - Used leadership roles or JTACs to request a repeat fire of the previous type. Applies to all supporting assets.
