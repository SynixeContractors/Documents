## Purpose of the Code of Conduct

This document will outline the expectations of our members both during gameplay and in general, including spaces outside of our community.

Your actions outside of this community reflect back on the values of our community, and we expect that you will follow these guidelines.

2. Names should be clear and easy to read.

3. Names must be in the First Last format.

4. Names must be unique within Synixe Contractors.

5. Names must not include ranks.

9. Names must not be that of a household name.

## General Conduct

Our goal is to have a fun, friendly, and welcoming environment for all members. We want to create good experiences for everyone, and we want to make sure that everyone is treated with respect and dignity. Teamwork is the key to success, and we want to make sure that everyone is working together to achieve our goals.

### Arma 3 is a Hobby

Everyone will have different schedules, priorities, goals, and interests. Members will take the various aspects of gameplay with varying degrees of dedication and seriousness.

Our members are allowed to be in other Arma 3 communities that do not have a time conflict, but we ask that if you hold a position of authority here, you do not hold a position of authority in other communities.

### Time Commitment

While we acknowledge that Arma 3 is a hobby, we still expect that you are making an active effort to be involed in our community. If you are looking for a place to play occasionally when you are in the mood, we encourage you to find another server. We are looking for people who are willing to dedicate time to our community and to the game.

We require active members to attend a minimum of one contract every three weeks. This is to ensure that we have a regular attendance and our mission makers and leadership can consistently plan.

If you will be unable to attend for a longer period of time, please let a member of our staff team know. You are able to take a leave of absence for any length of time.

### Social Conduct

We expect our members to follow these guidelines when interacting with others:

    * You are approachable and friendly.
    * You respect the privacy of other members.
    * You do not harass, threaten, or abuse other members.

    * You do not post content that contains personal information of fellow members.
    * You do not post content that is hateful, racist, or similarly inappropriate.
    * You do not post content that is illegal, threatening, or similarly inappropriate.
    * You do not post content that is sexually explicit, or similarly inappropriate.

### Failure to Comply

We will hold our members to a high standard, failure to comply with these guidelines will result in a warning or a ban at the discretion of the staff members. You are not entitled to a warning on your first offense.

## Cheating and Exploiting

Any deliberate action or attempt to enhance your gameplay or to give yourself an unfair advantage will not be tolerated and you will be subject to disciplinary action. Including but not limited to:

- Modification of game files or additional modifications outside of what is required by Synixe Contractors
- Attempting to gain access to other members' accounts
- Attempting to gain access to administrative tools
- Use of external communication platforms (Steam, Discord) unless authorized by a staff member for roleplay purposes
- Using any duplication or purchase bugs in our in-game shop, these should be privately reported to a staff member

## In Game Conduct

Your behaviour in game should be in line with the general conduct of the community.

### Roleplay

During some of our contracts we will have varying levels of roleplay aspects. We expect our members to act in a believable and immersive way, as a contractor of our private military company.

### Authority

We do not use any ranks to designate our members, instead our titles follow the time commitment of our members. We are always on a first name basis.

In our contracts we could have a junior member placed above a member in the chain of command. You are expected to respect the authority and follow the orders of the members placed above you at all times.

Collaboration is the key to success, and we expect our members to work together to achieve our goals, but when a decision is made by a member above you, you should act in accordance with the orders.

### Disiplinary Action

If you are caught doing something that is not in line with the general conduct of the community, you will be subject to disciplinary action.

#### 1. Fines

A fine can be imposed for breaking roleplay and immersion aspects of our gameplay. The amount of the fines is at the discretion of the staff members. Excessive incursion of fines may result in a permanent ban.

#### 2. Temporary Suspension

Temporary suspension can be imposed for breaking roleplay and immersion aspects of our gameplay, especially when it detracts from the enjoyment of other present members. The length of the suspension is at the discretion of the staff members.

#### 3. Permanent Ban

Permanent bans can be imposed for gross misconduct during our contracts.

### Prohibited Behaviour

#### Looting

The looting of items off of enemy units is a fineable offense. There are only two exceptions:

    * Medical gear when low and in urgent need.
    * Weapons when out of ammunition, in urgent need, and approved by an element level leader.

#### Possesion of Unauthorized Specialized Equipment

The possession of weapons and other specialized equipment that you are not qualified to have is a fineable offense.

#### Insubordination

Once an order has been given, you are expected to follow it to the best of your ability. If you are not following the orders of a member above you, you could be subject to a fine, or temporary or permanent suspension.

The time to discuss issues with the given orders is during our debriefing.

If the order would unnecesarily risk yourself, a fellow Synixe Contractor, the lives of neutral or civilian parties, or break any of Synixe's rules, it should be refused and reported to the OL or a staff member.

#### Intentional Friendly Fire

Any intentional friendly fire will result in a permanent ban.

#### Intentional Civilian Fire

Any intentional civilian fire will result in a minimum temporary suspension.

#### Intentional Executions

Any intentional executions of enemy units that have become incapacitated or otherwise no longer considered a combatant will result in minimum temporary suspension.
