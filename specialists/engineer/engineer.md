### Vehicle Repairs

#### Tires

Every vehicle should have at least 1 spare tire. These can be taken out of the cargo and mounted onto a wheel. Damaged tires should be placed back in the cargo if they are not completely destroyed, a damaged tire is better than no tire at all.

#### Component Damage

Various components of the vehicle can become damaged. These depend on the vehicle, but some common components are:

- Fuel Tank
- Engine
- Body

The fuel tank should always be checked for repairs first, as it may be leaking.

#### Repair Vehicles

Repairing when in close proximity to repair vehicles will allow you to repair the vehicle more than you would have otherwise.

#### Repair Facilities

Repairing vehicles while inside a repair facility will allow you to repair the vehicle completely.

### Vehicle Refueling

Refueling can be done by many different sources of fuel.

- Gas Stations
- Fuel Bladders
- Fuel Trucks
- Jerry Cans

To refuel from a gas station, bladder, or truck:

1. Park the vehicle in range of the source and turn off the engine
2. Grab the fuel hose from the source and attach it to the vehicle
3. Wait for the vehicle to finish refueling
4. Remove the fuel hose from the vehicle and return it to the source

### Vehicle Towing

!> Vehicle towing is currently unreliable, it should not be attempted unless absolutely necessary. A future update will include a more reliable method of towing.

Vehicle towing requires two vehicles and a rope. The vehicle being towed must have wheels and be suitable for towing. Do not attempt to tow vehicles that are missing wheels, very damaged, or otherwise dangerous.
