# Engineering - Vehicle Logistics

## Equipment

**Toolkit**: Used to repair and maintain the element's vehicles.

**Rope**: Used to tow vehicles.

## Vehicle Repairs

### Tires

#### Patching

!> Patiching is an experimental ACE feature we are testing, it may be changed or removed in the future.

A toolkit can be reused to patch tires that are slightly to moderately damaged. This is done by selecting the tire and using the toolkit on it. The tire is patched as the progress bar fills up, cancelling the action will leave the tire partially patched.

#### Replacing

Every vehicle should have at least 1 spare tire. These can be taken out of the cargo and mounted onto a wheel. Damaged tires should be placed back in the cargo if they are not completely destroyed, a damaged tire is better than no tire at all.

### Component Damage

Various components of the vehicle can become damaged. These depend on the vehicle, but some common components are:

- Fuel Tank
- Engine
- Body

The fuel tank should always be checked for repairs first, as it may be leaking.

### Repair Vehicles

Repairing when in close proximity to repair vehicles will allow you to repair the vehicle more than you would have otherwise.

### Repair Facilities

Repairing vehicles while inside a repair facility will allow you to repair the vehicle completely.

## Vehicle Refueling

Refueling can be done by many different sources of fuel.

- Gas Stations
- Fuel Bladders
- Fuel Trucks
- Jerry Cans

To refuel from a gas station, bladder, or truck:

1. Park the vehicle in range of the source and turn off the engine
2. Grab the fuel hose from the source and attach it to the vehicle
3. Wait for the vehicle to finish refueling
4. Remove the fuel hose from the vehicle and return it to the source

## Vehicle Towing

Vehicle towing requires two vehicles and a rope. The vehicle being towed must have wheels and be suitable for towing. Do not attempt to tow vehicles that are missing wheels, very damaged, or otherwise dangerous.

The engineer should get in and out of both vehicles. Attach the rope to the vehicle doing the towing first, then attach the rope to the vehicle being towed.

## Vehicle Cargo

Most vehicles have some cargo space that can be used for loading and transporting supplies.

### Loading

1. Carry / Drag the supplies to the vehicle, or drive the vehicle to the supplies when it is too heavy to carry.

2. Drop the cargo at least 1 meter away from the vehicle, to prevent any accidental damage.

3. Interact with the cargo and select `Load`, then select the vehicle to load the cargo into. If there are multiple vehices of the same type nearby, have someone get into the driver seat of the target vehicle. The names of the drives will appear next to the vehicles in the list.

4. Wait for the cargo to be loaded into the vehicle.

### Unloading

1. Park the vehicle near the desired unloading location. Make sure there is sufficient space for the cargo to be unloaded.

2. Interact with the vehicle and open the `Cargo` menu.

3. Select the cargo item to unload, then select unload.

### Airdropping

1. Open the cargo menu of the vehicle and select the cargo item to airdrop.

2. Observe the time it will take to air drop.

3. Wait until you are the correct time away from the target location, then select `Airdrop`.

4. The cargo will be airdropped at the target location.

## Vehicle Loading

Some vehcles have Vehicle-in-Vehicle (ViV) support.

### Loading

1. Drive the vehicle you want to load up to the rear of the ViV vehicle. If the vehicle is unable to move, carefully navigate the ViV vehicle to the front of the target vehicle.

2. Use the action menu to select `Load Vehicle`

!> Never attempt to drive the vehicle into the ViV vehicle, this will cause damage to both vehicles. The target vehicle needs to be behind the ViV vehicle, lined up straight, and not too close.

### Unloading

1. Park the ViV vehicle near the desired unloading location. Make sure there is sufficient space for the vehicle to be unloaded.

2. Use the action menu to select `Unload All Vehicles`

3. The vehicle will be unloaded from the ViV vehicle. It will be placed nearby on a flat, clear surface.
