# Medical Specialist - Medic

Medics are the first-line support for wounded soldiers. They are trained to perform a wide range of medical tasks, including treating wounds, administering drugs, and administering medical equipment. A medic's abilty to perform these tasks is crucial to the success of the team.

When deploying as a medic, it is important to remember that you are there to support your team, not to be on the front line of the battle. Even when a part of the front most team, you should still be aware of your surroundings and be protected. You can't help anyone if you are unconscious, or dead.

## Communication

Since the medic is such a crucial part of the team, good communication is critical. Medics should be assertive and direct, you are in charge of all medical procedures.

When you rendevouz with another team, give a quick shout asking if anyone is in need of medical assistance.

### Patient Ownership

Each person requiring medical aid should have only a single medic responsible for their care. If there are two medics working in close proximity, it is important to make sure that they are aware of each other and are working together. The medics will call out who they are responsible for and will ask for permission to perform tasks or take over a patient that another medic is responsible for.

## Injuries

**Avulsion**: Tissue forcefully torn away from where it belongs. On legs they cause a limp even without fractures. A severe type of wound with extreme pain and a high rate of bleeding.

**Velocity**: Deep penetrating wounds often caused by bullets. Hitting bone, they can cause fractures. Very high pain, fastest bleeding.

**Crush**: Tissue crushed under heavy weights. They can cause fractures and limping. Slow bleeding but great pain.

**Laceration**: Another tear that separates tissue without carrying it off and away. Moderate pain, medium blood loss.

**Fracture**: A broken bone. Caused by falling, ordnance and crashes. On arms, they cause extreme aim shake. On legs, they cause a limp. Extremely painful. No blood loss.

**Puncture**: Caused by shrapnel or slow-moving sharp objects. Occasionally causes limping. Light pain, slow bleeding.

**Cut**: Occurs from shrapnel or other sharp objects cutting skin and muscle. Light pain, light blood loss.

**Abrasion**: A scrape. Slow bleeding, though large ones cause a moderate amount of pain.

**Contusion**: A bruise. You cannot fix these with bandages, but they also don't lead to blood loss. They can cause moderate pain.  

## Medical Equipment

### Airways

**Guedel Tube**: Allows an unconscious patient to breath by preventing the airways from being blocked. Will be removed when the patient is conscious.

**Stethoscope**: Allows the medic to determine if there are injuries to the patients lungs.

**Chest Seal**: Used to close the chest of a patient that has been punctured, allowing air to enter or escape their chest cavity.

**Pulse Oximeter**: Used to measure the blood oxygen level of a patient.

### Circulation

**Packing**: Medium effectiveness, high chance to reopen, but excellent delay until a wound bothers you again. Basically an in-combat ‘fix now, medic later’ solution. A rifleman's best friend.

**Elastic**: Highest effect, worst chance to reopen, lowest delay. These are great to get through an emergency, but otherwise inefficient. Good for quickly stoping bleeding, but will require stitching within a few minutes.

**QuikClot**: Lowest effect, lowest chance to reopen, excellent delay. Its low effect means it’s great for small wounds, but needs substantial volume for large wounds; then used in calm situations with a large supply and supplementing packing.

### Medication

**Pain Killers**: Used to manage mild to moderate pain, they should not be given within 5 minutes of each other and take 1-2 minutes to have noticeable effect. Effects lats around 7 minutes.

**Morphine**: Drastically reduces pain, while also reducing the heart rate and dilating blood vessels, dropping blood pressure. Effects last around 30 minutes.

**Ephinephrine**: Used to rapidly increase the heart rate of the patient. Effects last around 2 minutes.

**Adenosine**: Used to rapidly decrease the heart rate of the patient. Effects last around 2 minutes.

### Other

**Splint**: Used to stabilize a patient after a fracture.

**Surgical Kit**: Used to perform stitching on bandaged wounds.
