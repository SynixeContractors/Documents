# Medical Specialist – Medic

Medics are the first-line support for wounded soldiers. Medics are trained to perform a wide range of medical tasks, including treating wounds, administering drugs, and administering medical equipment. A medic's ability to perform these tasks is crucial to the success of the team.
When deployed as a medic, it is important to remember that you are there to support your team, not to be on the front line of the battle. Even when you’re part of the front, you should still be aware of your surroundings and be protected. You cannot help anyone if you are unconscious, or dead.

## Communication

Since the medic is such a crucial part of the team, effective communication is critical. Medics should be assertive and direct; you are in charge of all medical procedures.

When you rendezvous with another team, give a quick shout asking if anyone is in need of medical assistance.

### Patient Ownership

Each person requiring medical aid should have only a single medic responsible for their care. If there are two medics working in close proximity, it is important to make sure that they are aware of each other and are working together. The medics will call out who they are responsible for and will ask for permission to perform tasks or take over a patient that another medic is responsible for.

## Injuries

**Avulsion**: Tissue forcefully torn away from where it belongs. On legs they cause a limp even without fractures. A severe type of wound with extreme pain and a high rate of bleeding.

**Velocity**: Deep penetrating wounds often caused by bullets. Hitting bone, they can cause fractures. extreme pain, fastest bleeding.

**Crush**: Tissue crushed under heavy weights. They can cause fractures and limping. Slow bleeding but extreme pain.

**Laceration**: Another tear that separates tissue without carrying it away. Moderate pain, medium blood loss.

**Fracture**: A broken bone. Caused by falling, ordnance and crashes. On arms, they cause extreme aim shake. On legs, they cause a limp. Extreme pain. No blood loss.

**Puncture**: Caused by shrapnel or slow-moving sharp objects. Occasionally causes limping. Light pain, slow bleeding.

**Cut**: Occurs from shrapnel or other sharp objects cutting skin and muscle. Light pain, light blood loss.

**Abrasion**: A scrape. Slow bleeding, though large ones cause a moderate amount of pain.

**Contusion**: A bruise. You cannot fix these with bandages, but they also do not lead to blood loss. They can cause moderate pain.

**Hemopneumothorax**: An injury to the thorax that can be heard with a stethoscope. If one of the two sounds has crackles the patient has a Hemopneumothorax. This is currently treated by returning the patient to base or a proper medical facility determined in mission by leadership. A patient cannot have all three of these ailments.

**Tension Pneumothorax**: An injury to the thorax that can be heard with a stethoscope. If one of the two sounds is short breaths the patient has a Tension Pneumothorax. This is currently treated by returning the patient to base or a proper medical facility determined in mission by leadership. A patient cannot have all three of these ailments.

**Pneumothorax**: An injury to the thorax that can be heard with a stethoscope. It can be diagnosed by seeing blood oxygen levels dropping quickly on the pulse oximeter. This is currently treated by using a chest seal on the patient’s thorax. A patient cannot have all three of these ailments.

## Medical Equipment

### Airways

**Guedel Tubes**: Allows an unconscious patient to breathe by preventing the airways from being blocked. Will be removed when the patient is conscious. With a guedel tube applied to the patient you or another person will have to listen for audio cues to know when the patient throws up meaning the airway will be occluded and head turning will need to be done until the airway is no longer occluded. Alternatively, an accuvac can be used to clear the occlusion. A Guedel Tube satisfies the “Airway Management Needed” aspect of the airways.

**KingLT’s**: KingLT’s are similar to the guedel tubes in that they allow a patient to breathe by preventing the airways from being blocked. However, after you use a KingLT on a patient you WILL NOT have to worry about the patient’s airways becoming occluded again until they wake up. These are good to use in a mass casualty event where there are multiple patients and all contractors still conscious are busy returning fire. A KingLT satisfies the “Airway Management Needed” aspect of the airways.

**Accuvac**: An accuvac is a device used to remove an occlusion from an airway. This can take the place of head turning

### Respiratory System 

**Stethoscope**: Allows the medic to determine if there are injuries to the patient’s lungs. I.E. Hemopneumothorax or Tension Pneumothorax.

**Chest Seal**: Used to close the chest of a patient that has been punctured, allowing air to enter or escape their chest cavity.

### Pulse Oximeter and Splint

**Pulse Oximeter**: Used to measure the heart rate and blood oxygen level of a patient.

**Splint**: Used to stabilize a patient after a fracture.

### Bandages and Surgical Kit

**Packing**: Medium effectiveness, high chance to reopen, but excellent delay until a wound opens up again. Basically, an in-combat ‘fix now, medic later’ solution. A rifleman's best friend.

**Elastic**: Highest effect, worst chance to reopen, lowest delay. These are great to get through an emergency, but otherwise inefficient. Good for quickly stopping bleeds but will require stitching within a few minutes.

**QuikClot**: Lowest effect, lowest chance to reopen, excellent delay. Its low effect means it is great for small wounds but needs substantial volume for large wounds; then used in calm situations with a large supply and supplementing packing.

**Surgical Kit**: Used to perform stitching on bandaged wounds.

**Suture**: Used with the Surgical Kit to close wounds. One suture is used per wound group. You can have multiple wound groups per limb. For an example if the patient needs stitches on two limbs, it will use two sutures, however if they have multiple wounds causing bleeding on the limb it will require you to use as many sutures as there are wounds bleeding.

### Saline

Saline is used to raise the Blood Pressure of a patient as well as stabilize a patient. It comes in these amounts; 250 Milliliters, 500 Milliliters, and 1000 Milliliters. For reference, an uninjured person has around 6 liters of blood in the body and 1 liter is equal to 1 thousand Milliliters. The minimal amount of saline needed to get someone up is 5.1 liters or “lost some blood” status.

### Injectors and Pain Killers

**Pain Killers**: Used to manage mild to moderate pain. They take 1-2 minutes to have noticeable effects. Effects last around 7 minutes. Max dosage is 6 painkillers within 7 minutes.

**Morphine**: Drastically reduces pain, while also reducing the heart rate and dilating blood vessels, dropping blood pressure. Effects last around 30 minutes.

**Epinephrine**: Used to rapidly increase the heart rate of the patient. The effects last around 2 minutes. 10 doses of Epinephrine within a 2 minute window will overdose the patient. 

**Adenosine**: Used to rapidly decrease the heart rate of the patient. The effects last around 2 minutes. 6 doses of adenosine within a 2 minute window will overdose the patient.
