# Introduction to Swifty

To enhance your Arma 3 experience, we require the use of Swifty. It’s a user-friendly, third-party launcher designed specifically for Arma 3. Swifty allows us to manage modded content seamlessly. It handles downloading, updating, and loading mods, enabling us to play without relying on the Steam workshop.

Additionally, we also use Swifty to test various mods still in active development, and/or those which have yet to be released! This flexibility ensures that forced/unplanned updates won’t disrupt our experience.

Below, you'll find a guide on how to install and use Swifty effectively.gaming experience.
