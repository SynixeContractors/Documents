# United Khaybaran States

## Overview

UKS is a constitutional republic under ruler Vivienne Lingolo with the title of Shah. It has risen from the local power of the region into a global transport hub due to its strategic location and very easily exploitable rare earth mineral deposits. It is surrouned by former colonial states with very unstable governments and often has to interject itself into foreign affairs.

Khaybaran military exports are limited to ground equipment which is produced by Ruelle Corporation on the outskirts of Khaybaran capital, Mazargan.

Pride of Her Majesty's Armed Forces are elite units of 18th Battalion Mountain Infantry "Garde de Pierre" which draws from traditions of mountain hunters from the northern regions.
