# Luban Union

## Overview

Luban Union is parliamentary republic with historically very weak governments due to huge plurality of smaller parties run by wealthy regional bussinesmen. It has suffered greatly over decades of neo-colonial exploitation and does not want to join any alliances as minor member.

Luban Army equipment is split between older equipment from post independence war, imported from Drovak in subsequent years and recently support from United Khaybaran States.
