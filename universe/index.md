# Synixe Universe

The "Synixe Universe" is a brief description of the fictional world our mission are set in. It provides context and background information to enhance immersion and storytelling.

The purpose of the Synixe Universe is to detach ourselves from real world alliances, conflicts, and politics. It opens up creative freedom for mission design and narrative development, allowing us to explore a wide range of scenarios without being constrained by real-world history.

A noteable difference from the real world is the absence of nuclear weapons, which has lead to a world with more conventional warfare and geopolitical tension. The major powers have populations that are not very interested in conflict, leading to a tense global atmosphere rife with espionage, proxy wars, and smaller players trying to assert themselves.

## Major Powers

There are three major powers in the Synixe Universe:

- [Virelia](virelia.md)
- [Calvane](calvane.md)
- [Drovak](drovak.md)
