# Asartan Republic

## Overview

Asarta is an impoverished post-colonial country with still majority of country being based on subsistence agriculture. Nominally a presidential republic but has been led by over 11 years by Grzegorz Nowak, a former bussinessman. They recently joined CSP due to external threat of its much larger neighbours due to recently discovered huge deposits of natural gas on in its border region. 

They have invested this recent boost in exports into rotary wing and tracked assets from Calvane. With little experience and investment in the ground element the future of their deploments is put into question.
