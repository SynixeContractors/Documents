# Kingdom of Illanz 

## Overview

Kingdom of Illianz is a colonial power still holding majority of its 20th and 19th century colonial holdings. With relaxed policy and brutal crackdowns they have managed to integrate the impoverished people of the colonies into an army that is very often intervening in policy of neighbours of its colonies and world renown for its wheeled pushes across vast empty areas to respond to threats across the boarder. Due to that light mechanized units of the kingdom are considered pride of the country.
